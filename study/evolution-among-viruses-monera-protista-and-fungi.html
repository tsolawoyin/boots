        <h3>Virus</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A virus is extremely small(smaller than every other living organism) and can only be seen through an electron microscope</li>
            <li>It does not have a cell strucure. A virus only has either RNA or DNA inside a protein coat.</li>
            <li>A virus can be regarded as a living thing and a non-living thing</li>
            <li>A virus is <strong>living</strong> if and only if it is <strong>inside</strong> a living organism e.g Pig</li>
            <li>A virus is <strong>non-living</strong> if it is <strong>not inside</strong>  a living organism e.g. table</li>

        <h3>Kingdom Monerans</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <strong>bacteria</strong> and the
            <strong>blue-green algae</strong> belong to this kingdom
          </li>
          <li>
            They are very <strong>small</strong> organisms and are made up of
            <strong>single prokaryotic cells</strong> enclosed within rigid cell
            walls.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cell structure is simple.
            <strong>They have no definite nucleus</strong> and the
            <strong>chromosome</strong> lie free in a particular part of the
            cell.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Bacteria (singular: bacterium)</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Bacteria can be seen through the high power of a light microscope
          </li>
          <li>
            They are found everywhere including
            <strong>inside your body</strong> and inside
            <strong> hot volcanoes</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Some bacteria look like sphere and are called <strong>Cocci</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Some bacteria look like rod and are called <strong>Bacillus</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Some are coiled or look like snake and are called
            <strong>Spirochaetae</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            A few type make their food through a process called
            <strong>Chemosynthesis</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Some are <strong>Saprophyte</strong> i.e they feed on dead organisms
            causing them to decay.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some live and feed on living organisms, harming them. Such bacteria
            are called <strong>Parasites.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Bacteria reproduce only <strong>asexually by binary fission</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Blue-green algae</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Are also referred to as <strong>cyano bacteria</strong></li>
          <li>
            They are found mainly in freshwater, and in damp places on land.
          </li>
          <li>
            They contain chlorophyll and so can make their own food through
            <strong>Photosynthesis</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            The chlorophyll <strong>is not located</strong> inside the
            chloroplast.
          </li>
          <li>They exist as single cell and colonies of cells</li>
          <li>
            Examples include: <strong>Nostoc</strong>,
            <strong>Oscillatoria</strong> and <strong>Anabaena</strong>
          </li>

        <h3>Kingdom Protista</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Protists are <strong>unicellular</strong> organisms(i.e they are made of one cell)</li>
            <li>They have an <strong>eukaryotic cell</strong> type</li>
            <li>Their cells have <strong>a true nucleus</strong> and <strong>organelles</strong>.</li>
            <li>The protists are much bigger than a bacteria</li>
            <li>They live in water, which include rivers, seas, moist places and body fluids</li>
            <li>Many of them move about with structures like <strong>flagella</strong> and <strong>cilia</strong> or by forming <strong>pseudopodium</strong>, also known as <strong>false feet</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are two major types of protists</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protophyta</strong> (Protists that have plant-like feature/characterisitcs)</li>
            <li><strong>Protozoa</strong> (Protists that have animal-like feature/characterisitcs)</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Protophyta</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>They have cellulose cell walls</li>
            <li>They possess chloroplasts which contains chlorophyll, hence they can photosynthesize or make their own food</li>
            <li>Examples include <strong>Chlamydomonas</strong>, <strong>Chlorella</strong>, and <strong>Diatoms</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Protozoa</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>They have no cellulose cell walls</li>
            <li>They have no chlorophyll, hence cannot photosynthesize</li>
            <li>Examples include <strong>Amoeba</strong>, <strong>Paramecium</strong></li>
        </ul>

            <li>A special protist that have both <strong>plant-like</strong> and <strong>animal-like</strong> features.</li>
            <li>It has chlorophyll which enables it to make its own food (plant-like). It is an autotroph</li>
            <li>It lacks a cellulose cell wall (animal like)</li>
            <li>It has a plasma membrane called <strong>Pellice</strong> (animal-like)</li>
            <li>It has eyespot or stigma which is sensitive to light</li>
            <li>It moves with the aid of flagellum</li>
