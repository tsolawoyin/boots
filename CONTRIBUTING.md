Suggestions regarding the User interface (how the app web app looks like) is also welcomed. The layout, the colors, e.t.c, 

### Add more questions to my questions database

Perhaps you have some specific questions you want to practice with, or you want to add more questions to Boots for everyone to benefit from, then continue.

Adding questions to Boots can be done in one way only for now. As time goes on, this will improve and become more easier.

1. Type your questions using microsoft word or any similar software and then send it to me via solitary.wolf@outlook.com for uploading. The uploading will be done in less than fourty-eight hours, depending on the length of the document.


### Contribute or improve my code base

If you want to contribute to my codebase, it's better for now to contact my author solitary.wolf@outlook.com about it, so that you can get to know eachother and communicate better about the project. 

### Donate to make me better

Boots is a developing web app intended to be free for everyone, and as such, needs some fund for its growth. For instance, Boots is currently running on a free plan on netlify, and that's why the domain name has .netlify.app in it. Getting a .com, or .ng, or some unique id requires funding. There are also many other parts of boots that requires funding as well, please feel free to contact the author solitary.wolf@outlook.com to know more if you have any questions. No amount is small. Thank you so much as you donate.
