# Hi, I'm BOOTS ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my codebase. Yes I'm open-source and I need your help to grow. [Want to contribute?](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### About me

My author [tsolawoyin](#) programmed me to help you pass your exams and gain some additional skills all the while having fun with yourself or with your friends. I am just a few months old and still under constant development but I would love to give a basic overview of how I function.

I am a very simple program with not so fancy graphical user-interface. I am preloaded with several questions which you can select and test yourself on. On the surface I look like so many test app out there but I am unique in some respect. 

- You can test yourself on specific topics in different subjects in one exam. For instance, you can test yourself on **antonyms in english**, **atomic structure in chemistry** and **genetics in biology** in one exam. 
- After mastering individual concepts, you can therefore test yourself on **general** which shuffles up all the topic in that specific subject.
- When the exam starts, your name is displayed and your time starts counting down. If you are new, you will notice `0.00` at the top. That is your current score in that specific subject. 
- Your current score updates as you continue the exam which means I mark your exams instantly. And once marked, there is no going back. This is meant to help focus and be certain of your answers before choosing and nexting.
- I also use negative markings to ensure that you refrain from guessing.

### Goals
- To help as many students as possible. Students from secondary and tertiary institutions alike.
- To have the largest database of questions
- To be free for everyone because education should be free
- To help students learn through the use of artificial intelligence like `chatGPT`for instance

### Current Subjects available for Practice
- English
- Chemistry
- Biology
