      <p>
        I am updating the conditions for this leaderboard. Please read
        attentively.
      </p>
      <p>
        First and foremost, I want to express my sincere appreciation for the hard work and dedication of our team. Seun, Daniel, Tosin, and Victoria, your efforts have been instrumental in Boots' improvement. While it's unfortunate that Victoria isn't currently able to compete alongside us, I have full confidence that she's doing her utmost wherever she is. Each of you has shown tremendous dedication and talent, and I'm grateful to be part of such a fantastic team. Together, I firmly believe we'll propel Boots to even greater heights. Let's continue working together towards our shared success.
      </p>
      <p>
        You guys are performing great in the leaderboard with Tosin currently
        at the top followed by Seun and Daniel while Victoria is at
        the bottom of the table. It is obviously not easy and I kudos everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on some reasoning, I have decided to change how the prize
        will be shared.
      </p>
      <p>The overall prize to be shared is #10,000</p>
      <p>The minimum score in JAMB to qualify for any prize at all is 200</p>
      <p>The first will take #6000</p>
      <p>The second will take #3000</p>
      <p>The third will take #1000</p>
      <p>No prize will be given to the last person and anyone that have less than 200 in JAMB.</p>

      <p>If you have any opinion regarding this change, please let me know.</p>
      <p>Wishing everyone success.</p>
