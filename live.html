      <h5>About Boots</h5>

      <p>
        In reality, Boots wasn't a planned or designed web application. Boots is
        merely the outcome of random nature. Boots was created in response to
        our little study group's requirement for software to practice questions
        and other things. Yes, there are a ton of websites and apps available to
        assist us with practicing, but I regret to say that I disagree with the
        majority of them's underlying attitude. Yes, some provide a vast
        question bank, charts, graphs, and even competitions with cash awards.
        These programs are helpful, but they are not meant to assist in the
        development of completely functional brains. I think they are more
        focused on making money. I therefore set out to design BOOTS in order to
        close these gaps.
      </p>

      <h5>What makes Boots different</h5>

      <p>
        Alright. First and foremost,
        <strong>Boots is free and it will be free for a very long time.</strong>
        I decided to make Boots
        <a href="https://github.com/tsolawoyin/boots">open source</a>,
        <em>GNU GPL-3.0 licence</em>, with the hope that I will get other
        programmers and volunteers alike to collaborate and together we will
        make Boots better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, Boots is like other practice software you are familiar with,
        with slight modifications.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Instant marking as opposed to marking when exam is finished. This I
          believe will force users to make corrections immediately.
        </li>
        <li>User score is displayed right after answering each questions.</li>
        <li>Score increases if user answer the current question correctly</li>
        <li>
          Score reduces if user answers wrongly. Simply put there is
          <strong>negative marking</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Score is unaffected if user doesn't attempt the questions. That is,
          you won't be rewarded or penalized for questions you don't answer.
        </li>
        <li>And the rest will be learned when you start using the software.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thirdly, Boots is <strong>not</strong> a
        <strong>JAMB practice app</strong>. Boots is a multipurpose practice
        software. I developed the software in order to practice any form of
        test. MCQs, theory, German questions e.t.c. But for now, most of the
        questions in Boots are JAMB questions. Most especially in English and
        Biology. Chemistry is a mixture of JAMB questions and questions from
        textbooks. But this is just as it is right now. Boots is roughly a month
        old, as it grows, this will change.

      <h4>For potential collaborators</h4>
      <p>
        Let me introduce myself. I am not a website developer per se; rather I
        study computer science at
        <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"
          >Open source society university</a
        >. Math and algorithms are my main areas of expertise. I also enjoy
        looping with recursion, which is my favorite looping construct. Imagine.
        Yenyenyen. But really, recursion is cool. I have written several
        variants of Dijkstra algorithms(not an achievement, though), and I have
        solved many difficult problems on CodeWars(no evidence because I deleted
        my account because it was distracting, but honestly, I was a 3kyu code
        warrior). I also created a small game called
        <a href="https://github.com/tsolawoyin/space-invaders "
          >Space invaders.</a
        >
        using Racket programming language; you can get the source code from
        github if you'd like to interact with it. Additionally, I support Linux
        OS. As Linux is free and open source, there's no reason to use any
        version of Windows. For both programmers and non-programmers, Linux mint
        or Ubuntu is suitable. Also, I use Python to code. I used Python to
        write five non-GUI programs. Moreover, it's on github.
        <a href="https://github.com/tsolawoyin/6.0001-assignments-solutions"
          >6.001 assignment solutions</a
        >. That being said, my first language is JavaScript. Sincerely, you will
        be much more proficient in javascript after reading the first 12
        chapters of
        <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">eloquent javascript</a>. And I
        respectfully chose to use basic JS syntax when writing the majority of
        the Boots source code. For two reasons: first, I hope collaborators will
        come on board, and second, I want to avoid giving too much explanation
        of how code like this one works:
      </p>
      <pre>
        function (roads) {
            let graph = []
            for (let [from, to] of roads.map(e => e.split("-"))) {
                ;graph[from] || graph[from].push(to)
                ;graph[to] || graph[to].push(from)
            }
            return graph
        }
    </pre
      >

      <p>
        Consider how sophisticated that code is, yet also how perplexing it may
        be. Thus, most of the Boots source code is straightforward to prevent
        those kinds of problems. There is no arcane syntax. There aren't many
        arrow functions, and if you know how to program, the architecture is
        easy to grasp.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, you might find me conceited, but all I'm doing is
        attempting to sell myself to you. And if you chose to assist me in
        working on Boots, that would be just wonderful. Together, let's create
        something magnificent to elevate people's mental state. Because in my
        opinion a great nation is made up of great minds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of Boots as a national initiative for Nigeria. A public-facing,
        open-source project
