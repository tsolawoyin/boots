        <ol>
        <li><strong>Difference in Osmotic Pressure:</strong> Marine fish live in a hypertonic environment, meaning the concentration of salts (solute) in the ocean water is higher than the concentration of salts inside their bodies (cytoplasm). On the other hand, fresh water is hypotonic, with a lower concentration of salts compared to the fish's body fluids.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Movement:</strong> Due to the difference in osmotic pressure, water moves into the fish's body through osmosis. In other words, water rushes into the fish's cells to try to equalize the concentration of salts between the fish's body and the surrounding fresh water.</li>
        <li><strong>Cell Swelling and Damage:</strong> The influx of water into the fish's cells causes them to swell. While some swelling is tolerable, excessive swelling can lead to cellular damage, particularly in sensitive tissues such as the gills and internal organs.</li>
        <li><strong>Disruption of Physiological Processes:</strong> The osmotic imbalance can disrupt important physiological processes such as ion regulation, kidney function, and gas exchange. This disruption can ultimately lead to organ failure and death.</li>

In freshwater environments, where the surrounding water is hypotonic compared to the cell's cytoplasm, water tends to move into the cell through osmosis, causing it to swell. Contractile vacuoles help maintain the cell's internal osmotic balance by collecting and expelling excess water.</p>
        <p>However, in marine environments, such as seawater, the concentration of solutes (such as salts) is typically higher than that of the cytoplasm of marine protozoa. Therefore, water tends to move out of the cell into the surrounding seawater, reducing the risk of cytoplasmic swelling or bursting due to osmotic influx. Consequently, marine protozoa living in isotonic or hypertonic environments may not require contractile vacuoles for osmoregulation, as the surrounding seawater helps maintain their internal osmotic balance.</p>`,
